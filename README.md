proj2-pd7-02-THE-ULTIMATE-MURDER-GUIDE
======================================

Welcome to the Shady, the ultimate tool for murderers!

This website is designed to help murderers hide their victims' corpses.

APIs we will probably use*:

  Google Maps - For finding hardware stores for shovels, burial locations
 
  Yelp - Lawyer ratings in case you get caught :(
 
  Weather Underground API - For determining the weather and seeing if it's suitable for burying a body. It also displays the forecast for the next 3 days in case that day isn't suitable. 
  
  *(API List is not set in stone. We may add more or remove some depending on the time we have)
  
  
CSS - Using Foundation 5
