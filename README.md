proj2-pd7-02-THE-ULTIMATE-MURDER-GUIDE
======================================

Welcome to the Shady, the ultimate tool for murderers!

This website is designed to help murderers hide their victims' corpses.

APIs we will probably use*:

  Google Maps - For finding burial locations
  Google Geocoding API to make use of latitude and long. data that google maps need.
 
  Yelp - Lawyer ratings in case you get caught :( It will display the top 6 lawyers, and how good the lawyers are. Clicking on their images will link to them on Yelp.
 
  Weather Underground API - For determining the weather and seeing if it's suitable for burying a body. It also displays the forecast for the next 3 days in case that day isn't suitable. 
  
  *(API List is not set in stone. We may add more or remove some depending on the time we have)
  
  
CSS - Using Foundation 5 
Javascript from foundation, javascript for google maps.
Note that Javascript wasn't used to extract info from json files (did that before javascript lesson)
However, the maps section uses javascript to properly extract info from the json api file.
